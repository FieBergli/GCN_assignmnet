        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",

You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",

The training loss decreases rapidly from approximately 2.9 to near zero within the first 30 epochs, indicating stable convergence.

        "We first trained the model using the original GraphClassifier defined in Question 16. This baseline architecture achieved poor performance with validation and test accuracies below 70%. To improve the model, we experimented by introducing dropout and exploring different pooling strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Replacing max pooling with mean pooling led to a noticeable improvement in validation accuracy; however, this strategy generalized poorly to the unseen test data, suggesting that relevant and important information was being lost due to averaging. In contrast, sum pooling preserves cumulative information within the neighbourhood, which appears to be particularly effective for this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining sum pooling with dropout resulted in a substantial performance improvement, achieving a validation accuracy of approximately 80% and a test accuracy of 77%. As shown in the figures above, the training loss decreases rapidly and stabilizes near zero, while the validation accuracy exhibits some fluctuations but shows a clear upward trend overall. This behavior indicates effective learning and good generalization. These results highlight the importance of the pooling strategy and demonstrate that different pooling methods can perform very differently depending on the dataset."

It also comes with custom code that takes care of aspects that you dealt with manually for this assignment, like a more efficient implementation of the adjacency matrix multiplication via message-passing methods, and Data Loaders that relieve you from having to build block diagonal sparse matrices.\n",
