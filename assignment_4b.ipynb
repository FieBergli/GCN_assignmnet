        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",

You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
